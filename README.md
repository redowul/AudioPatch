Connect multiple devices via Bluetooth to communally build a playlist. Build a music queue without having to pass phones around. Useful for parties, camping, car rides, any social venue where an internet connection isn't available or preferred, or just to share .mp3 files with others.

Features include a queue, audio objects constructed on-the-fly from transferred / tokenized data, asynchronous tasks, a search algorithm, and a file manager.
